# Bad Bank Refactor Project
> MIT xPRO - Week 27

This project was part of the course work required in the MIT xPRO Full-Stack development course taken.

## Description

This project exists to help banks turn from bad to good... This was a project to learn how to develop a full stack application who's end goal is to have a secure and functional banking platform. 

The app will help people who are in need of basic, but secure banking services. The app will however help the developer the most as he will need to have implemented many learnings to get the app up and running.

This app was build to learn to integrate various technologies to produce a useful product. It will solve both business (for the end user) and personal (for the developer) problems.
